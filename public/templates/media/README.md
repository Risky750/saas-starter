Place media/graphics template images or subfolders here.

- For multi-shot templates put them in a subfolder whose name becomes the template id (e.g. `studio-portfolio/shot1.png`).
- For single-shot templates place an image directly in this folder (e.g. `poster.png`).

URLs generated will be `/templates/media/<folder-or-file>`.
